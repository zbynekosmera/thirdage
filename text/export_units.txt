{dhow}	Válečná veslice

{dhow_descr}
Transportní loď umožnuje přepravovat armády a poskytuje částečnou ochranu proti pirátům, ale nedává moc naděje v bitvě proti námořnitvům zkušených mořeplavců, jako jsou například Gondorští, pokud je nepřečíslí ve velkém množštví.

{dhow_descr_short}
Tato jednoduchá loď slouží k přepravě armád a poskytuje částečnou ochranu proti pirátům.

¬----------------

{dragon_boat}	Dračí loď

{dragon_boat_descr}
Dračí lodě jsou velitelská plavidla Rohanské flotily. Vybavené kýlem a dvojitými řadami veslařů, což znamená dvojnásobnou bojovou sílu, neboť všichni veslaři jsou zároveň válečníky. Tyto lodě vezou balistu k vystřelování háků, aby bylo možné nepřátelské lodě přitáhnout k sobě a provést nalodění.

{dragon_boat_descr_short}
Větší verze dlouhé lodě schopná vést větší počet muží stejně jako háky určené k zahákování a nalodění na nepřátelská plavidla.

¬----------------

{dromon}	Númerrámar

{dromon_descr}
'Západní křídla' nebo 'křídla Západu' je překlad jména této lodě z prastarého jazyka. Tento název vychází z její velké rychlosti a lehkosti. Námořníci, kteří se na ní plavili popisovali tuto zkušenost jako kdyby loď letěla na křídlech. Ačkoli je lehká a manévrovatelná je to pořád válečná loď a neměla by být podceňována, neboť dokáže porazit většinu jiných plavidel.

{dromon_descr_short}
Lehká a manévrovatelná válečná loď, která by neměla podceňována kvůli její velikosti.

¬----------------

¬----------------

{holk}	Palarran

{holk_descr}
Tato těžká, ale přizpůsobivá loď tvoří páteř flotily. Může být vybavena zásobami na delší plavby než Númerrámar, neboť jeho jméno palarran znamená 'cestovatel do dáli' ve vznešené řeči západu. Může se postavit pirátským lodí a očekávat vítěžství a když se utká s korzárskou lodí tak může i doufat v remízu, když je dobře ovládán.

{holk_descr_short}
Tato těžká válečná loď dokáže překonat prakticky všechny protivníky, jen Korzárská loď jí může činit problémy.

¬----------------

{caravel}	Alcarondas

{caravel_descr}
Alcarondas znamená 'Hnad na moři' ve staré řeči západu a opravdu dostává svému jménu. Má několik stožárů, vyvýšené paluby téměř jako malé pevnosti na přídi i zádi s lučištníky a dobře vycvičenými námořníky, k bránění jejích 'zdí'. Přesto není těžkopádná a je rychlá a schopná relativně obratného manévrování v bitvě. Alcarondas by dokázaly překonat jen lodě vyrobené elfími loďaři v Lindonu - a těch je již jen pár a jsou daleko. Ani korzárská loď se nemůže rovnat této slavné námořní lodi, tomuto plavícíme se monumentu Dúnedainského námořnického dědictví!

{caravel_descr_short}
Velká válečná loď sloužící na dlouhé cesty a výpravy.

{Mounted_Longbowmen_descr}
Although many longbowmen possess horses for transport, only a select few have sufficient skills in archery and horsemanship, to fire from horseback. Being mounted allows for increased mobility enabling the longbowman to out flank his enemies and ride out of danger. However, these men are by no means real cavalry and should be kept away from those that are.

{Hand_Gunners}	Hand Gunners

{Hand_Gunners_descr}
Called "hand guns" to distinguish them from cannons, these are the earliest form of personal firearm. Consisting of a rudimentary metal tube mounted on a wooden pole and awkwardly ignited, this basic design left little room for aiming. These weapons caused more panic than actual damage to enemy troops who were shaken by the noise and smoke made when firing. Given their short range, their firers need to be well armoured and able to look after themselves in close combat.

Although these archers are not as skilled as Elves, nor do they wield the fabled hollow steel bow of the Númenóreans, they should still be a force to reckon with. The strength and stature of these archers means they can shoot a Longbow with ease, even if they’re clad in full plate armour. The armour means they need a longer time to reload their great bows and are slow to move, but they will stand their ground in melee combat. Armed with a sword and trained as Gondorian Infantry, they fear few enemies and are expected to fend off most attacking infantry.

Nevertheless, the need for these chargers is as great as their numbers are few for such warriors can turn the tide of a battle in an instant bringing victory to the elves and their allies.

In the year of 1697 of the Second Age forces of Sauron the Deceiver swept through Eregion laying waste to Ost-in-Edhil and its community of the elves' greatest smiths and craftsmen who labored there under Celebrimbor ever striving to perfect their craft. Even though Sauron was eventually driven from the region Eregion lay abandoned and ruined for thousands of years well into the Third Age. But now that the War of the Ring has set the elves on the warpath once again, they have decided to reestablish their community in Eregion and set alight its forges once again. Where the Gwaith-i-Mirdain of old were primarily focused on jewels and crafts designed to bring the beauty of Valinor to Middle-Earth this new generation of Eregion Smiths have turned their talents to the production of finest weapons and armour meant to hasten the Dark Lord's demise. Many of the remaining elven-smiths and apprentices have flocked to Eregion looking to restore Ost-in-Edhil and its workshops to some of their former glory and their determination can be seen not only in their fervent willingness to bring back the ringing of anvils and tools to these overgrown ruins but also in their readiness to take up the arms that they have created and take them to the enemy to be tested in the fires of battle. The warrior-smiths of Eregion are armed and armoured with their own work and are more than proficient in its use. Heavy mail of supreme quality covers them from head to toe and their chosen tool of war, the hammer, delivers brute grace to the enemy bones.

Imladris is perilously located in a deep valley at the base of the Hithaeglir, the Misty Mountains, where many bands of orcs roam in anticipation of the coming conflict. Although well hidden, Elrond's "Last Homely House" is constantly alert to any danger heading its way. Riders from Rivendell regularly patrol all approaches keeping watch and intercepting orcish scouts. More than just sentries, the Riders are a battle ready force with the intent to engage and turn away enemies before they can defile the peace and beauty of Imladris and the surrounding vale. The moors, foothils and forests around the Misty Mountains are unsuitable for traditional cavalry tactics yet mounts are necessary if the lands are to be effectively patrolled and protected. To that effect, Imladris Riders wield bows and swords form atop a horse and give fight to the enemy both from afar and up close according to need while their scale armour keeps them mobile and offers decent protection. Showering them with arrows and then following up with swords is a favored tactic against bands of orcs and raiders but heavier troops require that more of a distance be kept. Whether they are engaging directly or simply harassing the enemy, the Riders embody both the elves' affinity for archery as well as swordplay.\nREQUIRES IMLADRIS

It is the same kind of victory that the Longspears seek to gain now, in the Third Age, and finish what the Last Alliance started by vanquishing Sauron once and for all. Their long, two handed spears can impale a charging horse or skewer an orc with eqaul ease while keeping the enemy at a distance and allowing other forces to engage from the flank.

Following Silvan Elf tradition, these warriors bear wood spears into combat with a sense of pride, instilled by the long-held traditions of ages past. They are professional warriors, drawn from the Golden Wood of Lothlorien and from among the foreboding boughs of Mirkwood. Though armored sparingly, these Elves are efficient at holding the line against a pressing tide, granting archer companies the safety to pepper the enemy from afar. Equipped with short spears and round, wooden shields, Silvan Spearmen are solid defensive units, able to resist attacks from both foot and horseback, so long as they are well-supported.

Forest Wardens are the unseen part of an elven army. These Silvan Elves have lived in the woods for a long time and have perfected the art of stealth and hiding. Many Orcs have fallen to their blades without even knowing who killed them or seeing no more then a shadow moving through the woods. However, these units aren't equipped to keep up a prolonged fight. If they fail to completely destroy an enemy they must run away and lay another ambush, as surprise is their biggest strength.

The Silvan Elves are the ones who inhabit Mirkwood. In these dark days of the Third Age, the Realm of Mirkwood is the only really significant elvish faction still standing. Because of that, it has passed through many hard times against the hordes of Sauron´s minions. And because of that, Silvans are hardy people, willing to sacrifice all for the forests they love. The Heavy Spearmen are among the finest of the Silvan army. They are heavily equipped and wield their spears with a deadly grace. However, they are not as useful at fighting in woods because of their heavy equipment, but if King Thranduil wanted a battle in the open, he would rely on these battalions for the core of the army. Supported by archers and Heavy Swordsmen, they can be a severe threat to the enemies of Mirkwood.

Blessed by the Valar in ages long forgot, all Elves were made immortal. Though they were free from the mortal worries of disease and age, no Elf was free from the ravages wrot by the wars fought on Middle-Earth. And now, facing war yet again, the Silvan Elves prepare their best warriors for a conflict that will be remembered for generations to come, sung in heroic fashion by bards far and wide. Elite among the Silvan army, Silvan Heavy Swordsmen are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. Wielding the specialized two-handed, long-hilted blades of their race, these heavy infantry make short work of almost any enemy infantry. Protected by the finest gold-mithril mail Elven artisans have to offer, Silvan Heavy Swordsmen cannot help but to go down with a fight, able to hold their own against most infantry and even cavalry. Do not let their majestic demeanor fool you, for many enemies who have done just that were oft left lying in a pool of their own blood.

Trespassing into a wood held by the Silvan Elves, is, quite literally, suicide. If within the first moments of your trespassing your body sprouts feather-fletched arrows, then a company of Silvan Archers is likely the culprit. These elven battalions patrol the borders of the Silvan realm, slaying every manner of evil in their wake, whether it be as minor as a large spider or as deadly as a cave troll. Protected by lightweight leather armor beneath their cloaks, weidling bows and Elven blades, these excellent horsearchers excell at guerilla tactics, using stealth to ambush any enemy that dares enter their sacred homelands. Besides being superb waylayers, Silvan Archers are reliable units, useful for steadily thinning enemy ranks with their deadly volleys of arrows and can become capable melee units if necessary. Silvan Horsearchers, due to their ambush abilities, archery skill, and remarkable speed, are a key component to any Silvan army.

The desert of Harad is a land that is hostile to all life, a place where the water is scarce and the heat is relentless. Although almost none on Middle-Earth could live in these conditions, there are those who made this place their home, and they are the Haradrim. Even though there are not many things to hunt in Harad, for the desert is too hot to cultivate in some areas, there are still many skilled hunters who had to adapt to these conditions to survive, and those adaptations make them skilled and enduring archers. If the need arises, these hunters would protect their homes from any threat with their bows. Even though they are only equipped with a simple bow and a scimitar, the life in the desert has turned them into fearsome warriors, and the general that doesn't consider them a major factor on the battlefield will be taken by surprise.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.

Thus many men of Harad, especially young ones, flock to the Haradrian army banner eager for glory and plunder. Protected by leather vests with spears and small round shields in their hands, these war bands march in large numbers to engage the bulk of the enemy force and screen their archers from cavalry charges, while the elites take up more favorable tactical positions. Hardened by life under the blistering Southron sun, these men are not afraid to fight but they won't willingly give their lives either unless there is some worthwhile reward to be gained.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.

Their cutlasses and machetes lend themselves well to the Corsairs' wild and ferocious fighting style, while their increased mobility at the cost of armour allows them to direct their aggression to the right place at the right time.

Considered medium cavalry, these lancers can be used as shock troops or for completing a rout and running down fleeing troops. They are equipped with a slightly lighter lance than that of the Serpent Guard, but are extremely deadly wielding it.

Their scale mail coats cover almost their entire bodies including the head, leaving only a narrow opening for the eyes so that they may unnerve their foes with a cold-blooded poisonous stare while their wicked scimitars deal a swift and fatal blow. The Serpent Guard are utterly devoted to their Sultans, and their loyalty wins them the biggest share of any plunder and many privileges. This cycle of exchanging wealth and loyalty forms the foundation of Harad's warrior elite, and the preservation of their status makes these soldiers extremely well motivated, not to mention that they practically thrive on conflict, having built their lives around it.

The Guard is made up of seasoned warriors who have served in the field for many years. They wield a Great Lance and a small cavalry shield for protection and are, therefore, best used as shock troops. There are few soldiers in Middle-earth that will not be crushed under their charge.

They are equipped with scale-mail vests that give good protection for the body but lack effective head protection, preferring instead to wear the traditional Haradrian headdress.

Emerging from the southernmost expanses of Harad's desert and jungle regions they appear to the Gondorians as living legends come to haunt them. Arriving from unknown lands with unknown motives the Troll-men fight with great ferocity that seems completely undeterred by their lack of armour or sophisticated weapons. Being perfectly adapted to life in the most inhospitable of deserts their strength and endurance are considerable and Troll-men require little sophistication to be an effective fighting force. Their frightening, at times almost deformed, appearance and seemingly scorched skin is what earns the Troll-men their name though none, save the Haradrim, know their true origin or nature. Whether they are a product of exotic climate or dark sorcery Troll-men represent a deadly threat on the battlefield.

Throughout all the long ages of Arda, none so coveted the riches of the earth or delighted so much in the working and crafting of those riches as much as have the Children of Aulë, the Dwarves. As such, the Dwarves have become particularly proficient in the delving of mines through their perpetual quest to obtain ever more of the metal ores and precious stones that lie hidden beneath the lands of Middle-earth. The Dwarves are certainly not alone in their love for all that glitters. Those who have tried to seize that which have been gained through the toil of dwarven miners have found that dwarven pickaxes can be as effective in splitting skulls as they are in hewing rocks.

After the fall of Khazad-dûm and the establishment of the Kingdom under the Mountain, the Kings of Durin's Line ruled from a time from the Grey Mountains, where they tapped the riches that lay hidden beneath the mountains. In the wastes to the north, however, dwelled cold-drakes, lesser dragons who survived the War of Wrath and escaped the destruction of Beleriand. For a time, the valiant warriors of the Ered Mithrin held off their assault, but the death of Dáin their King led them to ultimately abandon their mines. Defeated, though not broken, these dour veterans keep watch over the lands of the north, their unmatched skill at arms honed and tempered through desperate combat against some of the most terrible servants of Morgoth who yet remain in Middle-earth.\nREQUIRES GREY MOUNTAINS

Khazad-dûm was founded during the early First Age by Durin, the eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves. As such it is not only the greatest dwarven realm in Middle-Earth but also the cradle of dwarven history and identity. It is the place where the greatest dwarven heroes fought and also died as the Children of Aule struggled to hold on to their ancient heritage as well as the precious Mithril veins found nowhere else in Middle-Earth. Sauron's hatred of the dwarves who dwelled in Khazad-dûm and their elven allies caused the Misty Mountains to become infested with Orcs bringing the dwarven stronghold under almost perpetual siege and and plunging it into an uncertain fate. The vast underground kingdom's best hope lies in the elite warriors whose veins are said to run with the blood of Durin himself. The Guards of Khazad-dum are outfitted with the finest Mithril reinforced arms and armour still available in the ancient armouries of their forefathers. Faced with swarms of orcs, cave trolls and perhaps even greater horrors that dvell in the deep places of the Earth, the Guards wear Mithril lined steel masks representing their unflinching resolve to safe-guard their ancestral dwellings no matter the cost. The star emblem on their shields represents the crown of stars Durin saw when he looked into the waters of Mirrormere which led him to found his kingdom under the Dimrill Dale.

Although most of the races of Middle-earth favor the use of sword and spear in the conduct of war, no weapon is perhaps as associated with the Dwarves as is the axe. Indeed, axes are as useful to Dwarves as tools in times of peace as they are as weapons in times of war. Furthermore, the natural strength and stocky build of the Dwarves give them a particular affinity for wielding axes. Few there are who can withstand the might of a single dwarf armed to the teeth and wielding a long-hafted axe. Fewer still are there who can endure against an entire company of dwarven axemen.

Erebor, the Kingdom under the Mountain, was founded by Thráin I of the folk of Durin after the loss of Khazad-dûm. Under his leadership and that of subsequent kings, the Dwarves of Erebor amassed wealth to rival that of the Dwarven mansions of ages past. With such wealth, however, came unwanted attention, and in time the kingdom was sacked and its treasures lost to Smaug, the last of the fire-drakes. It was not until many years later that Erebor was reclaimed and the Kingdom restored. Having so recently recovered their lost wealth, the Dwarves of Erebor are not likely to give it up lightly, and as such these elite warriors, each bearing a great battle-axe and encased in steel, keep vigilant watch over the Lonely Mountain. Those who covet their treasures know well their fearsome war cry -- Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!\nREQUIRES EREBOR

Dwarves are no strangers to the bow, though of late those among the folk of Durin with aptitude in archery have increasingly adopted use of an new innovation, the crossbow. Indeed, for the stout dwarven archer a stock-mounted weapon such as the crossbow is far less cumbersome to fire than a more traditional bow. Furthermore, few other than the Dwarves possess the skill in metalwork necessary for the crafting of the intricate trigger mechanisms that give the crossbow its particular utility. Admittedly, a crossbow cannot match a bow in terms of its rate of fire. However, it can impart a projectile with far greater kinetic energy with a more traditional bow. As such, a dwarven crossbow is in many respects similar the one who wields it: slow, though powerful and deadly.

Against men and elves, Dwarves are particularly disadvantaged by their short stature. To remedy this shortcoming, some dwarven warriors have adopted the halberd, the crude -- though effective -- combination of an axe head and a long pole. In orderly formations, halberds allow dwarves to hold enemies off at range. However, for combat in close quarters, a dwarven halberdier will often switch to a double-bladed axe in order to finish off his enemies.

An exceptionally strong and large species of trolls which live in the mountains surrounding Mordor, they are exceedingly dim witted like the rest of their kind but make up for it with brute strength. Not much is known about these trolls due to their proximity to Mordor, but what is heard would grip the heart of any an in a cold vice, twelve foot tall creatures with massive strength and who know no pain would be fearsome opponents to even the bravest of men.

Once men who were given Rings of Power, each fell into the shadow and succumbed to One Ring and it's master, the Dark Lord. Led by the Witch-king of Angmar, the Nazgûl are enemies most foul, and rare it is to stand against one, let alone Nine, and emerge victorious. Forsaking their steeds to instead summon death on foot, these faceless creatures bring dread and doom to all but the stoutest of hearts, and their martial prowess is no less daunting.

{Orc_Band_descr}
A tragic and degraded parody of elves engineered by the fallen Vala Melkor, orcs have been the mainstay of evil's presence in Middle-Earth for thousands of years. Providing the bulk of labor and soldiers for their dark masters, the orcs have perhaps sacrificed as much to destroy Middle-Earth as the Elves have to preserve it. Though untold thousands have fallen by elven arrows, human swords, and dwarven axes, the orcs' dark pact with evil endures into the Third Age. As Sauron now prepares for his newest campaign against the Free Peoples he is able to quickly call on massive reserves of orcish rabble for any thankless task that needs to be done. Standing on the battlefield with cheaply crafted spears and shields, the lowly yet numerous orcish bands' dark blood will once again blacken the ground as they absorb their enemies' main charge, allowing Mordor's deadlier creatures to take up flanking positions.

With the advent of a new war they had been tasked with probing Gondor's defenses and harassing the elves of Mirkwood and Lorien, but now Sauron's conquests have taken them from their usual prowling grounds straight to the walls of Minas Tirith, Caras Galadhon, and beyond. Though their scavenged and improvised weapons and armour together with a lack of tactical sense for open warfare make them unsuited for head on clashes with decently equipped and disciplined troops, inexperienced or overconfident commanders just might find their lines broken and overrun by the raiders' sheer numbers and beastly aggression.

Morannon Guards are built to protect the main entry to the dark lands of Mordor, they protect the plains of Udûn. They are armed with heavy spears and iron shields, and they wear heavy mail forged in the deeps of Barad Dûr and Durthang.

The Orc Scouts are clad in thin scrap armor. They wear a thick combination of thick cloth, tattered chain mail and thick leather; anything they could scavenge. They cannot wear heavy armor, as they are required to move fast and hide. Their primary arsenal is a crude bow that they would fire at a safe distance. These orcs are not close combatants of any kind, so they prefer to stay away from straight melee battles. But in the event when they do need to defend themselves they are properly armed with short blades.

Bows made by the orcs are of sub-standard quality. Often they would break from extended use, or from not receiving proper care and maintenance, as orcs care little for their tools. Arrows on the other hand are more durable and can be reused time and time again. Most often only the shaft or the feathers need replacement. Orcs being clumsy marksmen rarely hunt bird, thus they use fur and sometimes hair from various animals and creatures as arrow feathers. For protection the archers wear simple and worn-out scavenged armor pieces, as they need the freedom of movement to wield their bows. They carry a dagger and crude short swords to defend themselves at close combat, which none of the archers would like to experience.

In origin, Sauron was a Maia named Mairon. In the earliest of days he was among people of Aulë, the Smith the ruling powers of the world. However, Mairon was soon ensnared by Melkor (Morgoth), who wished to rule and order all Arda. Mairon was renamed Sauron served Morgoth faithfully, and even in later days, after Morgoth was defeated and locked outside the confines of the world, Sauron encouraged and coerced Men to worship Morgoth as a God. However, while Morgoth wanted to either control or destroy the very matter of Arda itself, Sauron's desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its creatures. It was in this that Sauron was perhaps more practical than his master Morgoth. Sauron is the Chief Lieutenant of Morgoth, who after his fall became another Dark Lord, and ultimately walks down the same ruinous path to oblivion. In Sindarin he is called Gorthaur and also he is known as the Necromancer, the Abhorred Dread and the Nameless Enemy, whereas Morgoth is the Dark Enemy. The Dúnedain call him Sauron the Deceiver due to his role in the downfall of Númenor and the Forging of the Rings of Power. His two most common titles, the Dark Lord of Mordor and the Lord of the Rings, appear only a few times. His other titles were similar to Morgoth's.

Their combination of strength and mobility makes them suitable for several different roles as scouts, raiders, or even "bounty hunters," as their endurance makes them relentless trackers.

Dunlendings handpicked by Saruman to guard Isengard have a mixed heritage as they can trace a part of their bloodline to the old Gondorian garrison that watched over the fortress in the early Third Age. During the Great Plague of 1636 Gondor's hold on the Gap of Rohan (not yet known as such during that time) weakened and the hereditary chieftains of Isengard intermingled with the local Dunlendings until Gondor's influence in the region completely disappeared. After a prolonged conflict with the Rohirrim Dunlendings were eventually driven out of Isengard by King Frealaf of Rohan. Now that Saruman has become the new master of Orthanc he has opened the gates of Isenguard to Dunlending loyalists once more. These men have a vested interest in preserving their new position as Guardians of Orthanc since their service to Saruman affords them greater rewards, status and safety within the walls. Unlike their less organized fellow tribesmen they train to fight as heavy infantry in defensive close order. Their thick armour is provided by Isengard's forges and shows some Gondorian influence in its design.

{Uruk_Cleavers}	Skřetí urukští sekerníci
{Uruk_Cleavers_descr}
While the Uruk-hai are capable of higher orders of organized warfare Reavers emphasize typical orcish aggression and brutality. Brandishing bardiche type axes Reavers are able to utilize their enhanced strength to produce powerful swings capable of severing bodily extremities in one clean strike. Even cases of completely cleaving poorly armoured opponents in half are not nearly as uncommon as Isengard's enemies would like them to be. Armour usually does little to alleviate great damage to the torso though the victim may at least be "fortunate" enough to remain in one piece literally speaking. To achieve these great feats of dismemberment the Reavers need to remain fairly mobile and flexible so with the exception of shin guards and some upper arm protection the Reavers' own limbs are exposed to allow for easier and faster movement. Hard leather with some iron plates covers the torso and waist but the weapon requirements deprive them of shield protection. However the increased mobility and the axes' polearm design make the Reavers ideal companions for the Raiders on their forays especially against the Rohirrim as long axes are well suited to taking down even heavy cavalry provided they don't take the brunt of the charge. All in all the Reavers are an excellent "hammer" for as long as there are other troops present to take the role of the "anvil".

Products of a fallen Istari's ambition and lust for power, these creatures are as beastly and frightening as orcs yet strong and disciplined as any soldier of men. Standing in an ordered line wearing plate armour and bearing large iron shields, the Uruk-hai can withstand the worst that the enemy can throw at them while their cruel angled blades wielded with savage fury will cut down all who oppose the White Hand.

Saruman's immediate goal, the conquest of Rohan, brings him into conflict with the finest cavalry force in Middle-Earth. With this in mind many of his fighting Uruk-hai are outfitted with immensely long two-handed pikes. The resulting spear wall, several ranks deep, maintained by heavily armoured Uruks leaves no hope for any potential cavalry charge, and even other infantry will be hard pressed to withstand the cleaver-like blades of the Uruks' pikes. However, the formation severely lacks flexibility and the long pikes deprive their holders of shields, requiring the presence of supporting infantry to secure the flanks and counteract any missile troops.

All the inhibitions that allow other Uruks to remain disciplined in battle despite their savage nature are removed as these Uruks' aggressive nature is unleashed to its fullest potential, transforming them into a whirlwind of violence. In this uncontrolled and rabid state they are set loose upon the enemy to wreak havoc with their two-handed cleavers in an orgy of blood and gore. While fighting, Berserkers completely lose themselves to their blood lust and enter a trance-like state feeling no fear, pain, or fatigue. Indeed, even after sustaining fatal wounds, many have been reported to continue fighting until their body literally shut down. In the midst of carnage and unbridled chaos Berserkers hear only one voice, the voice of Saruman.

Taken from the ranks of raiders, these Uruks often accompany their sword wielding brethren during raiding missions or are garrisoned at frontier outposts of Saruman's domain, where they look out for potential attacks and ward off smaller groups of intruders. Their bows are nothing fancy but they are very sturdy, allowing the Uruks to use their strength to draw the bowstring farther than most without sacrificing rate of fire. This can result in especially powerful and damaging shots, provided they hit the target.

These dark-skinned monstrosities wield powerful crossbows that, once loaded, are easy to aim and fire and can easily penetrate all but the strongest armour. This enables them to take out high value targets while their natural resilience and thick plate armour allow them to do so under sustained attack as the Uruk army advances on enemy positions.

Warg Riders are one of the rare examples of cavalry where the mount is more dangerous than the rider. Wargs, intelligent demonic wolves, have a long standing relationship with orcs and now they both serve Saruman, riding into battle together to bring terror to the free peoples of Middle-Earth. Not as fast as a horse in full gallop, Warg mounts nevertheless possess many advantages. They are much more dexterous and sure-footed and can traverse forests and difficult terrain with ease. Also, as predatory beasts, Wargs are formidable foes even without their riders. Their snarling visage instills paralyzing fear into the Wargs' enemies just before they sink their large dripping fangs into the victim's flesh. All but the most battle conditioned horses fear them and Wargs consider them nothing more than food. The Wargs' weaknesses lie in their fear of fire and relatively bulky frame that makes them easy targets for arrows and spears.

Bred only for war and trained to protect their general at all costs, these perfected soldier orcs are the mad wizard's best chance of realizing his ambition to rule Middle-Earth.

{Snaga_Skirmishers_descr}
"Snaga" is a term meaning "slave" in the Goblin tongue, used when referring to those classed as "lesser Orcs". Being a Goblin prisoner is not an enviable position, as they are either put to work within the tunnels, sent to battle, or worse. These slaves are those dredged up to fight, equipped with light, armour-piercing throwing spears and given no armour whatsoever. On the battlefield, they are expected to close with the enemy and deliver medium-ranged volleys into their ranks, an extremely dangerous task that more often than not is intended to merely distract the enemy while the main Goblin force marches unmolested. Few Skirmishers survive their first battle, but they are little missed by their commanders. Cowardly and extremely vulnerable to enemy attack, Snaga Skirmishers cannot be relied upon during a prolonged engagement, and are best utilised as close support for other units, or simply as fodder.

Drawn from the immense population within Moria, these Orcs make up the rank and file of any Goblin army. With keen eyesight and incredible speed, they are able to cross great distances quickly and make excellent scouts. In combat they wield a motley assortment of hand weapons and shields, usually scavenged from enemy corpses or bolted together from whatever various materials can be found within the Misty Mountains. Due to their poor equipment, stunted physiques, and cowardly nature, Goblin Infantry make below-par soldiers, and cannot always be relied upon during a prolonged melee. They are best when used en masse, or for catching routing enemies with their superior speed.

These warriors are amongst the largest and strongest of the Misty Mountain breed of Orcs, and as such make far better soldiers than their lesser kin. Armoured with heavy metal plate and jagged shields, they make very good warriors on the battlefield. While not as skilled as an Elf or as hardy as a Dwarf, in true Goblin style they compensate with vast numbers, swarming the enemy ranks in a fast-moving, glinting tide, hacking and slashing viciously at their foes with wicked blades and shrill war-cries. In large numbers, these troops can overwhelm enemies, wearing them down until all resistance is ultimately quashed. It is only when isolated that these troops are ineffective, and in such cases they are easily destroyed.

{Moria_Halberd_descr}
Most higher-class Goblin soldiers are typically stronger and larger than average, none more so than Halberdiers, who simply would not be able to wield their halberds effectively otherwise. Clad in sturdy Goblin-forged plate, these troops are also able to inflict massive amounts of damage with their highly versatile weapons, and can counter both horses and infantry very effectively. As Halberdiers are the only Golbin infantry unit effective against cavalry, they form constant contingents within the armies that march forth from the Misty Mountains. Heavy Goblin Halberdiers are best used defensively and in large numbers to support other Goblin troops, with whom they are better protected from harm and can take enemies entrenched in melee by surprise.

{Snaga_Archers}	Lehcí skřetí lučištníci
{Snaga_Archers_descr}
Slaves and prisoners of the Moria Orcs, Snaga Archers are malnourished, poor troops who are little more than conscripts. Wearing naught but the mottled skin on their backs, these archers are given only a small bow and sent out to battle alongside a Goblin host. As such, they are commonly used as meat shields for other Goblin units, especially archer groups, with whom they are also able to at least deal some damage at the same time. Isolated, Snaga Archers are extremely easy prey, vulnerable to any enemy attacks and incapable of holding out in melee against even the weakest assaults. Cowards all, these slave troops are only effective as combat units when deployed in large numbers, but are a cheap and highly-renewable resource to any Goblin commander.

{Goblin_Archers_descr}
Generally formed from the weakest and most-stunted Orcs within Moria, these troops have little value as individual soldiers. Lightly armoured, poorly equipped, and bad marksmen to boot, their main strengths lie in the swift movement and sheer numbers typical of the Goblin race. Able to traverse any battlefield with speed and bring a hail of arrows down upon their foes, these archers are a huge asset to any army, despite their physical drawbacks. Though they are highly vulnerable to enemy attack and hardly competent with a bow, when ammassed in large numbers they can bring down most enemies, loosing thousands of poisoned black arrows with every deadly volley.

Better-clad and stronger than other Goblin bowmen, Heavy Goblin Archers are the best long-ranged unit available to an Orc commander. With their thick plate armour and superior numbers, these troops are able to take a large amount of damage on the battlefield, giving them the advantage in nearly all prolonged ranged engagements. While not incredibly accurate, as with all Goblin units their main strength is in the huge numbers they are able to field in battle, vastly outnumbering the enemy with rank after rank of armoured soldiers. Able to move quickly and hit hard at range with large numbers, Heavy Goblin Archers are best when used to soften, distract and separate enemy units using hit and run tactics, where their decent armour and superior speed provides them with a huge advantage.

While not as physically robust as their specially-bred kindred from the land of Mordor, these creatures make deadly foes on the battlefield, and cause frightening amounts of damage at close range. Despite the fact that they bear no armour, their incredibly tough troll-skin is able to withstand tremendous punishment in a fight. This, combined with the devastating hammer that they so effortlessly wield, serves to make Cave Trolls some of the most deadly troops in Middle-earth, capable of smashing apart anything or killing anyone with ease.

{Goblin_Wargs_descr}
Warg Riders are one of the rare examples of cavalry where the mount is more dangerous than the rider. Wargs, intelligent demonic wolves, have a long standing relationship with orcs and goblins, riding into battle together to bring terror to the free peoples of Middle-Earth. Not as fast as a horse in full gallop, Warg mounts nevertheless possess many advantages. They are much more dexterous and sure-footed and can traverse forests and difficult terrain with ease. Also, as predatory beasts, Wargs are formidable foes even without their riders. Their snarling visage instills paralyzing fear into the Wargs' enemies just before they sink their large dripping fangs into the victim's flesh. All but the most battle conditioned horses fear them and Wargs consider them nothing more than food. The Wargs' weaknesses lie in their fear of fire and relatively bulky frame that makes them easy targets for arrows and spears.

{Balrog}	Balrogs
{Balrog_descr}
Balrogs were in origin spirits of fire who belonged to the order of the Maiar. The Dark Lord corrupted them to his service in the distant past of the world. They were said to have a man-like appearance, with burning yellow eyes and streaming manes that kindled with fire. Furthermore they had long and powerful arms, wings consisted of shadow and a heart made out of fire. Balrogs are spirits of fire, but sometimes they shroud themselves in darkness and shadow. Also, when getting into contact with water Balrogs could turn into monsters of slime. Melkor originally gathered them to Utumno, after the destruction of that fortress by the Valar the Valaraukar fled to the ruins of Angband, where they would lurk in its pits for three ages. Eventually the Balrogs issued out from their hideout to rescue their lord and the Silmarils from Ungoliant. In the years to follow they would bring chaos and destruction among the armies of both Elves and men, slaying many skilled warriors with whips of flaming thongs, with great black axes and with flaming swords. Most notable among the Valaraukar was Gothmog; the Lord of Balrogs and High-captain of Angband. He was responsible for the slaying of both Fëanor and Fingon, but eventually Gothmog was killed by Ecthelion of the Fountain, though the latter also died in the duel. After the War of Wrath most Balrogs were defeated by the armies of the Valar, it is rumored though that one of these demons of fire survived and fled east over the Ered Luin to hide under the deep caverns of the Caradhras. This Balrog remained undisturbed for thousands of years, but the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm delved to deep for their greed of mithril and eventually they stirred a great evil that should not have been awakened. This spirit of fire caused great destruction upon Khazad-dûm and forced the Naugrim to flee from the halls of their forefathers. Khazad-dûm was renamed to Moria, which means the Black Chasm and the Balrog would become known as Durin's Bane. This Balrog is one of the last true powers from the ancient days and it is clear that there are few powers left in Middle-earth to oppose him.

Snaga means slave in orcish and Snagas are the most disdained members of orcish society. They are a feeble and cowardly lot, avoid open battle as long as they can and prefer riskless bloodshed, murder of the helpless in the cover of the night and plundering without defense. The Snagas of the north often leave the security of their underground homes to go on long raids, mostly under the leadership of a few superior ocs. They roam the dark woods and hills of the barren wilderness of Eriador to burn down remote hamlets and farms, hiding from the daylight, travelling only at night with relentless stamina. Snaga Stalkers have become very familiar with the wild lands and are well capable of hiding and ambushing. They are barely armoured and their arms would be considered as rubbish by most people, but now that they have grown numerous and bold again in their old strongholds in the north they might even dare to show in the open – as long as they know the whips of their masters behind them.

Towards the end of the Third Age they have grown in numbers and they feel the call of their dark lord far in the south and once again they prepare to pour out of their subterraneous cities and outposts and overrun the plains of the north, defiling the lands with their presence and bringing a new darkness over Middle-earth. Orc Bands are equipped with everything that they can find, mostly parts of leather and chain armour and crude spears, a weapon both cheap and not needing much talent or training to do some damage.

Long before the Uruks were bred in the dark towers of Barad-Dûr and Orthanc, there were already champions among the orcs of the north, exceptionally large and strong either by a mere chance of nature or maybe because they were remains of forgotten malicious experiments of Morgoth in the First Age when he first created these creatures of hate. In the huge and crowded city of Gunabad, the largest and most savage orcs form warrior bands to defend their interests and combine their strength in battle. These Orc Fellers consider themselves superior to all other orcs and don’t like to take orders or cooperate. Their own chieftains fear them, especially since many of them originally came from their ranks and so they are only too glad, that their potential rivals rejoice in the wildest battles and always attack were the battle is most dangerous and the slaughter most bloody without any hesitation or fear. On the battlefield the Orc Fellers are pure embodiments of raw, ancient, orcish strength and brutality, hacking easily even through the thickest armour with large two-handed axes. Their patchwork armour is above average, but in their arrogance they use no shields and thus are easy targets for arrowfire.

Orcs might be usually badly organized but that doesn’t mean they are stupid. Sly orc chiefs have learned their lesson from the bloody toll the orcs had to pay in the wars against the dwarves and picked some of the larger and stronger orcs to form a force that is able to withstand better armoured and disciplined enemies. It needs hard training to bring them to hold their ranks closed in the heat of battle, but with constant beatings and threats the Orc Halberdiers are forged to a unit that is difficult to overcome for everyone. Orc Halberdiers are equipped with the best armour their chieftains can provide and use all kinds of vicious polearms that wicked orcish minds could invent to bring enemies to the ground from safe distance before hacking them to pieces. A wall of orcish halberds is also almost impenetrable for cavalry.

An orc has few friends and many enemies, especially a powerful one. Nevertheless every ruler needs someone he can trust and amongst orcs trust is usually bought by rewards, privileges and the first share of the loot. The Orc Marauders get all this and more and in return they take care of insurgents, protect their master and the grisly emblem of his rule, kill his rivals and terrorize those who oppose him. As every small orc chief has his own “private army” and the orcs of the north have many chiefs, they can assemble in frightening numbers when a greater warlord unites the chiefdoms for a greater campaign and the banners of all his thralls and followers and those wo serve them assemble. Though Orc Marauders prefer it when others do the dirty work for them, they are a force to be reckoned with in battle – you won’t gain respect or even survive long amongst orcs without being a good fighter and they get the best equipment their chiefs can obtain. They form the hard core of Gundabads armies that is usually kept back until the decisive moment when the enemy is weakened enough by the slaughtering of thousands of worthless Snagas.

The lands to the North of Rivendell are considered to be desolate and empty, inhabited only by Orcs, Trolls and other vile creatures. Yet this is not entirely true. From the days of the Second Age, a grim folk dwelled in the mountain vales of the Misty Mountains. Descended from the wild tribes of the White Mountains or some say even from Ulfang the Black himself, Hill-men fell under the reign of the Witch-king of Angmar, and usurped power in Rhudaur. Scattered and broken after the defeat of their master, they fled northward. Their numbers diminished, but not their hatred towards the people of Bree, their distant kin, and the accursed Dúnedain. Armed mostly with spears they use for hunting wild beasts, and small wooden shields, Hill-men can often be seen among the first ranks of Orc hordes, rampaging in the lands of North Eriador.

The people became embittered, foul things crept out from the North and after series of conflicts with their former brethren of Arthedain and Cardolan, the kingdom was annexed and terminated by Angmar. Today Rhudaur is just a name on the map. There are several scattered villages and farms of former inhabitants of the kingdom, who mingled with wildmen and men of the hills. They brood the grudge against the Dúnedain and their Elven allies, who drove them to the mountains, to die on the cold rocks. Armed with crude axes and javelins, which they use before charge, clad in sturdy leather and chainmail, Rhudaur Axemen are ready to offer their services to any orc chieftan, who would help them regain the lands of their fathers.

Horses are not very common in the northern parts of former Rhudaur. There is no forage to feed them, only rocks, boulders and occasional spots of green, and this grass is precious for cattle. To the south, there are pastured that can be used, but most of them are watched. Watched by restless Rangers of the North, who guard the borders of more densely populated lands. Rhudaur Scouts are adopt at raiding villages of the Dúnedain, lightly armoured, armed only with simple sword, spear and plain buckler.

While most goblins prefer to stay in their deep caves and caverns most of the time, Goblin Trackers often prowl in packs through the deep forests of the north, like predators, preying on animals and men alike. Their sharp eyes pierce every darkness, their steps are totally soundless and they smell the enemy from far away. Once they are on the track of a victim, it never escapes – except maybe when it is one of the rangers of the north, their most hated enemies, with whom they live in a constant struggle. Goblin Trackers might be despised by the larger warrior orcs, but they are stronger and prouder than the mere Snaga scum and more cunning than the average orc. When the armies of Gundabad go to war, they form the vanguard, leading the way, the snouts close to the ground, scouting the foe and showering him with a rain of arrows, before the main army attacks.

The axe is an invaluble tool to the Rohirrim in times of peace and a deadly weapon in times of war. The men that wield it are usually not professional soldiers, but that does not mean they should not be feared. The blood of the middle men burns brightly in their veins, and the servants of the Dark Lord would be folly to cross them. They also carry a shield and mail, and their axe gives them a consideable advantage over heavily armed opponents.

Though the axe is a popular weapon for soldiers of Rohan, wielding a sword shows that the wielder is a man of more than average combat skill. These swordsmen hail from the Folds of Rohan, minor noblemen, freemen, and veteran soldiers – they all have superior training to the common soldiers. They are clad in decent armour, all wearing at least ring-mail, their endurance in battle depending on it. At times if the need arises, the Rohirrim fight on foot, and they do it as well as on horseback. These Rohan swordsmen can punish most other infantry.

But when the shadow of war is upon Rohan, the Royal Guard is summoned by the king and accompanies him to battle either by foot or horse.

What is a Rider of Rohan without his horse? An excellent spearman that can't gallop, that's for sure. These Spearmen of Rohan are courageous warriors, and without their normal mounts they are only encouraged to fight harder! Fit with ordinary scale-mail and wielding a fine spear and round shield, the greatest weapon these Spearmen possess is their ability to unseat other horsemen with calm and cool precision and efficiency. Rohirrim translated from Sindarin means "Horse-lords," and it is immediately obvious that the people of Rohan are the unparalleled masters of horses. This natural affinity between the Rohirrim and their steeds gives them a unique and deadly set of battle tactics, for no one knows how to use AND defend against a furious cavalry charge better than the Horse-lords themselves! Rohan Spearmen may not have the best armor or the strongest resolve, but what they do have is a natural ability to deftly wield a spear in many different ways, and expertly impale an Uruk or a Warg in many different places.

Rohan is not well known for its archers, but that doesn’t mean that the Rohirrim make no use of them. Some men simply can’t afford a horse, or they dismount to fight in fortresses on foot. The Archers of Rohan, compared to other archers in Middle-earth, are only average shooters, but they still have many uses for any Rohirrim commander. The men that choose to use a bow instead of fighting with spears and swords are often those that either live in wooded areas or in the wide lands of the north. In those lands they use the bow as their primary weapon for the hunt, and that has given them a certain expertise which is useful in battle. These men wear mail armour and a helmet for protection, and they use a simple axe for close combat situations. Eorling Archers have somewhat low morale and they are not to be expected to turn the tide of a battle, but as long as a wise commander keeps these men out of the battle clashes, their arrows will find their targets and contribute greatly to the Rohirrim.

Rohan Riders are medium armoured companies which form the backbone of Rohan's army. These companies are formed from horsemen who cannot afford expensive heavy armour. Still, their lighter armour protects vital body areas and allows these riders to be fast and agile. Without heavy armour and with unarmoured horses, these units are cheaper to equip and make deadly, mobile cavalry that can strike hard and pull out quick, and then repeat until the enemy has had enough.

Being a nation that that has such a rich history of cavalry it is only natural to have mounted archers. Armed with a good bow and coupled with a swift horse, these horse archers can be a formidable force. These men give Rohan the long range that they desperately need without having to be slowed down by foot archers. Armed with an axe when close quarters ensues, they are capable of self-defense, but it's best to keep these men out of the thick of battle, for they lack a shield and the heavier armour of their more melee-based counterparts.

They have, like regular militia, light or no armour. Maybe some woolen and leather clothing, but that's it.

Far away from the dangerous northern and western borders, with a lot of open field and some distance between settlements, Bree-land had no need for heavy armoured troops. Swiftness was the key, so cavalrymen were lightly equipped with spears and round shields designed to fight against poorly armoured enemies, mostly bandits or roaming bands of orcs.

Men who join the ranks of the Sentries are chosen for their knowledge of the terrain and endurance and survival skills, considering they are almost constantly on the move and spend most of their time in the wild. Despite the already great demands, these men train ceaselessly to master their bow, sword, and steed.

These are the gruffest of hobbits and the few among their kind who follow the call of the warrior. It is the hobbits' peace loving nature rather than a lack of physical ability that makes them unsuitable for war but those halflings who are of a sterner disposition can be as dangerous in combat as the "Big Folk". Utilizing their smaller size, good hand-eye coordination and stocky build the Bandobras Archers can slay their opponents from afar using short war-bows or in close quarter with their short swords.

They come from all walks of life, blacksmiths provide any weapons and armour they can spare, carpenters craft the shields, spear shafts and bows while farmers take care of provisions. Experienced hunters, fighters or any other skilled men teach the basics of firing a bow or thrusting a spear and all these people working together form a community militia to deter roaming bands of outlaws and orcs. These people have no noble heritage to speak of nor do they own high badges of glory and honor with which to boast but their freedom is their dearest possession and they will not give it up lightly.

Living outside the normal society exposed to dangers that plague the lands has made these bandits hardened and gruff and there is little they wouldn't do to improve their lives. Despite their ways the fate of these men is tied to that of Eriador and war has presented them with an opportunity to both earn coin and give relief to their violent tendencies.

As war brews once more the woods grow even more dangerous with roaming gangs of bandits and orcs forcing the lumberjacks to work in larger groups for mutual protection. Through years of dealing with these hardships Eriador's Woodsmen have grown accustomed to either fighting back or hiding depending on the situation.

Farming and cattle breeding in Eriador isn't as bountiful or reliable so as to remove the need for hunting and Eriador has enough game to ensure the continuation of this practice. Much of the region consists of smaller villages and settlements where civilization hasn't quite settled yet and many of it's people seek life among the trees wishing to be independent and self-sufficient. They roam the forests and hills in search of game animals but alas, in these unfortunate times, the hunter often becomes the hunted. In situations like that he must employ all of his cunning and skill with the hunting bow to survive. The hide armour that the hunter himself makes will protect him from cold weather or a wolf's bite but swords, spears and arrows are a completely different matter. Nevertheless these men are survivors greatly familiar with forested terrain and capable of obtaining almost everything they need with a simple knife.\nREQUIRES FOREST REGION

With trouble brewing all around, the sparse settlements of Breeland find themselves vulnerable and exposed to attack. Realizing their weakness the townspeople of Bree and the surrounding villages have banded together to weather the coming storm. They come from all walks of life, blacksmiths provide any weapons and armour they can spare, carpenters craft the shields, spear shafts and bows while farmers take care of provisions. Experienced hunters, fighters or any other skilled men teach the basics of firing a bow or thrusting a spear and all these people working together form a community militia to deter roaming bands of outlaws and orcs. These people have no noble heritage to speak of nor do they own high badges of glory and honor with which to boast but their freedom is their dearest possession and they will not give it up lightly.

The ancient Kingdom of Arnor has just recently been restored! More than ever, the Arnorian Kings have to rely upon every men capable of fighting to protect the fledgling nation. The switch from a formerly abandoned and disunited region to the restoration of ancient Arnor will take time; as such the military system has not yet been completely reinstituted. This alone means that even the common folk of Arnor will have to take up arms for the defence of their lands, due to the lack of professional soldiers and efficient fortifications. The Arnorian Militia mostly consists of the poorer classes of Arnorian society. As a result they can not afford to buy expensive equipment of high quality. They wear brown clothes which overlap on their leather armour, but, for protection, they wear a simple iron helmet and a wooden shield of average quality. For offensive useage they carry a wooden spear with an iron tip. Though these men can not trace their ancestry back to the ancient Númenóreans of old, they are still proud to be part of the restored Kingdom of Arnor, which they show by painting the White Tree on their shields and adorn themselves with symbols that they have painstakingly etched and embroidered upon their clothes. Their pride in their nation also means that these men, who are mostly of Bëorian stock, are motivated and willing to fight and die for the Kings of Arnor.

Archery has been part of the Númenórean tradition of warfare and hunting for centuries, the Númenóreans, for example, are credited with the invention of the steel bow; which is a great bow made from hollow steel. Furthermore the ancient Númenóreans considered the bow of Bregil to be one of their dearest treasures. This tradition with the bow has not been forgotten in the successor state of Arnor; as if in homage to their ancestors, many men arm themselves with a bow as their weapon of choice in battle. However, these bows do not have the same quality which the elder steel bows had. The Arnorians currently use simple yew bows, fired by men who can not trace their ancestry back to the Númenóreans of old, but instead claim to be descendants of the Folk of Bëor who stayed in Eriador. These men are yet servants of the Arnorian Kingdom, and their loyalty lies to the bloodline of Elendil. The modern Arnorian Archers consists mostly of these middle men. They learned their craft primarily through hunting, but it is also founded in basic training which they received while they were in the army. These men do not normally belong to the forces of Arnor, but sometimes they are called upon to fight for their King. In battle they wear long-weathered and well used leather armour and their heads are adorned by simple iron helmet. In addition to this, they carry a bow of average quality and wield a sword which they use in case they must confront the enemy in close-combat. For additional protection they also have a shield on their backs, which they wield alongside their sword if should they run out of arrows. Though these men have decent morale, they should not be expected to hold the line for a long of period time.

Due to the ever weakening border defences and the small population of Arnor, the Kings of Arnor considered it necessary that every man in the Kingdom should serve some years in the army of Arnor, to bolster the numbers of the Royal forces. Most men from Arnor who join the army are incorporated into the ranks of the Arnorian Men-at-Arms. There they learn the basics of swordsmanship and the bitter arts of war. These men are positioned all over the Kingdom, patrolling the streets of ancient Arnorian cities, or setting watch upon the various border fortifications of Arnor. In battle they form the backbone and most numerous part of the the King's army. To perform their duties stolidly, they are provided with quality mail armour and a helmet deftly forged to resemble the Númenórean helmets from the Second Age and the Arnorian helmets of the early Third Age. In addition, they also carry a large shield and a longsword, which they wield with more than passing skill. The colour of their clothes is black, with the White Tree and the Seven Stars proudly blazoned on their chests. This shows their loyalty to the Kingdom of Arnor and their pride to have a partly Dúnedain heritage. Their morale is excellent in battle, as they feel duty to their liege and a deep responsibility to protect the restored Kingdom of Arnor at all costs.

Archery has been part of the Númenórean tradition of warfare and hunting for centuries. This tradition with the bow has not been forgotten in the successor state of Arnor; as if in homage to their ancestors, many men arm themselves with a bow as their weapon of choice in battle. The Arnorians use yew bows, fired by men who can trace their ancestry partly back to the Númenóreans of old, but also to men of the Folk of Bëor who stayed behind in Eriador. The men who are part of the Arnorian Heavy Archers are often chosen from the ranks of the Arnorian Archers precisely because of their skills with the bow. These men are thus extremely experienced and have already proven themselves to be loyal in battle to their commanders. They usually learn their skills with the bow during hunting, as a result of that most men who chose to become archers in the Arnorian army hail from forested areas in the newly reforged Kingdom of Arnor. The Arnorian Heavy Archers are part of the standing army of the Arnorian King, they are required to be deployable at any time, to swiftly counter invasions from enemy forces. In battle these men wear mail armour and their heads are adorned by a helmet which resembles those of the Númenórean Bowmen of the Second Age. They also carry a longbow of excellent crafting and wield a sword which they use in direct confrontation with the enemy in close-combat. Their morale is excellent, their arrows deadly and the White Tree on their chests show that they are proud to be part of the newly founded Kingdom of Arnor.

The pike is a relatively new weapon in the armouries of the King of Arnor, it is one of the few weapons that was not based upon designs from either the Númenóreans of the Second Age or from the Arnorians before their downfall. In those days long forgotten there was no need for a pike unit on the ancient Island of Númenor and on the original Kingdom of Arnor; enemies where scarce in those days: foes on horses even more rare. However, with the recent Warg breeding programs used by the White Wizard in Orthanc, the population increase of Wolves in the Vale of Anduin and a southern migration of White Wolves from Forochel, there is need again for an anti-cavalry unit. The Arnorian Pikemen unit was the most efficient solution offered to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, and Arnor has embraced it. Their long wooden pikes are excellent for keeping cavalry at bay, while they are also efficient against infantry forces. In close-combat these men are vulnerable though, so to at least give them some protection, they are provided with quality mail and plate armour and a helmet that resembles the helmets that were crafted in ancient Arnorian forges. These men deploy various tactics on the battlefield, often working together as a unit, this is one of the secrets that makes them so effective against more disorganised and undisciplined forces. However, what the Arnorian Pikemen gain in discipline and morale, they will lose in manoeuvrability on the battlefield.

Enemies are lurking around the borders and waiting for any opportunity to attack. It is not too cofortable to live in endless fear, so Arnorian warlords have to raise army capable to hold against their foe and to strike back when it is necessary. These mounted soldiers are chosen as sergeants, because of their fighting and commanding skills among other Men-at-arms. Many of them belonged to middle class of society and were able bear the cost of armor and horses. Sergeants are honored by Arnorian soldiers and feared among their enemies as they often form spearhead of army and are last thing the orc raider or hill-men sees. Such a symbols as white three on chest at wings at helmet shows that design of armor is influenced by gondorian culture. Still arnorian armor is much more lighter, due to lack of materials and skilled armorers. Sergeants wear chain mail and iron helmet. Even on back of the horse their favorite weapon is sword, but they use their spears to charge down the enemy. Sergeants can be backbone of army and change the tide of battle when it is necessary, as the courage burns brightly in their hearts.

Light-armoured archers and lately mailclad knights took places in new battle formations.

Knights of Arnor consist mostly of former Greenway Guards and other skilled riders, while Dúnedain enter the elite order of Knights of Annuminas. They are given untilled lands in the vast deserted regions of the North Eriador to protect the borders of the kingdom and gather in times of need to king’s banner. Knights are very-well equipped, clad in partial plate and carrying large black shields. They wear broad swords with deadly skill, splintering shields and cutting goblin heads.

Khand, lying south west of Rhûn, has been the traditional ally of the Easterlings since the time of the Wainriders. As such they supply mercenaries to the Warlords and the Lôke-Khan whenever asked. These take the form of Kataphrakts, warriors, and most typically Raiders. The Dismounted Variag Raiders are fast moving archers and form a perfect counter-part to the guard of the Easterlings. Outfitted with light leather lamellar and steel helmets Variags carry composite bows and axes into battle. In times of need, the Variags can be mounted and serve as cavalry where their skills rival those of the Lôke-Khans own elite archers.

{Rhunnic_Crossbowmen_descr}
For thousands of years the bow has been the weapon of choice for the men of Rhûn. However, not long after Alatar and the Lôke-Khan arrived in Rhûn with their armies so did another terrible weapon, the crossbow. Brought from further east by Alatar and originally thought to be of eastern dwarven construction, the crossbow found itself well at home within the armies of the warlords. Easy to use and even easier to train for, the Warlords found it easier to arm their clansmen with the crossbow rather than trying to piece together groups of archers. Even with its ease of use the crossbow of the Easterlings is still out ranged by their composite bows, placing its operators in greater danger as they close with the enemy. In an attempt to eleviate this crossbowmen are typically outfitted in additional armor made of leather and steel similar to that of the clan warriors.

{Mounted_Clanguard}	 Jízdní stráž
{Mounted_Clanguard_descr}
Many of the clans cannot produce their own cavalry. Their horses are used as beasts of burden and not for war, so the Warlords have very little cavalry at their disposal. They typically rely on their allies in Khand to supply mercenary cavalry to augment what little they do have. Typically the Warlords of Rhûn field cavalry in the form of the Horse Guard. The Horse Guard draws from the Clan Guard, taking only those that show superior riding skills. They are a fast-moving medium cavalry, excellent for envelopments and running down the enemy. Exchanging halberds for spears they are also equipped with steel lamellar armor which gives them strong protection in combat but also ease of mobility atop their mounts.

In the open landscape that stretches and rolls south from the Iron Hills along the rivers Running and Redwater the bow continued to be relevant to military use.

Unfortunately Melkor's and Sauron's wars wrought great destruction upon Middle-Earth's forests and by the time of the Third Age the Ents became isolated and contained to Fangorn Forest. Feeling betrayed and forgotten they care not for the wars and struggles of Middle-Earth's peoples, spending their time tending to the last remnants of the ancient primeval forests. As the conflict between the Free Peoples and Sauron escalates it may soon spill out into Fangorn, the Ents' last refuge, and should that come to pass the forest shepherds' wrath may become known once more. Ents differ greatly in size, appearance and form just like the different species of trees that they guard and which they tend to resemble. The one trait all Ents share is their immense strength which is said to surpass even the mighty trolls who are said to be Morgoth's imitation of Ents. Therefore, when enraged, the apparently docile forest shepherds can turn into frightening opponents able to crush most flesh and blood creatures with a single blow or swipe of their powerful limbs. However their apathy towards anything that doesn't concern their woodland domain may make stirring them into a war-like disposition difficult.

While most peasants in Middle-earth were levied into the army, at sword point if need be, some welcomed the opportunity to earn some pay, and travel to defend their homeland. Their bows are designed for hunting rather than war, so are only effective against lightly armoured foes. They carry a knife for protection, but should be kept out of hand to hand combat, and will probably run away if any seems likely.

{Dale_Cavalry}	Dolská kavalerie
{Dale_Cavalry_descr}
The cavalry of Dale are rare because the terrain of Dale isn't suited to horse, but in recent years they have become more numerous, and often sell their services to the dwarves of Erebor, who have literally no cavalry. The reason for this increase in numbers is the fall of the kingdom of Rhovanion. The people of this land were excellent horsemen and their kingdom was in the open lands east of Mirkwood and south of Dale, but they were destroyed by the Balchoth horde from Rhun. Much of the remaining population either migrated north to Dale and Lake-town or west to the Eotheod. These horsemen greatly increased the cavalry of the dwarves and men of Dale. The best horsemen formed the knights of Rhovanion, and the rest were recruited into the Dale Cavalry.

{Mordor_Orcs_Invasion}	Skřetí nájezdníci
{Mordor_Orcs_Invasion_descr}
Orcish looters make frequent forays into neighbouring lands, pillaging and terrorizing any poorly defended settlements. With the advent of a new war they had been tasked with probing Gondor's defenses and harassing the elves of Mirkwood and Lorien, but now Sauron's conquests have taken them from their usual prowling grounds straight to the walls of Minas Tirith, Caras Galadhon, and beyond. Though their scavenged and improvised weapons and armour together with a lack of tactical sense for open warfare makes them unsuited for head on clashes with decently equipped and disciplined troops, inexperienced or overconfident commanders just might find their lines broken and overrun by the raiders' sheer numbers and beastly aggression.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.

Bows made by the orcs are of sub-standard quality. Often they would break from extended use, or from not receiving proper care and maintenance as orcs care little for their tools. Arrows on the other hand are more durable and can be reused time and time again. Most often only the shaft or the feathers need replacement. Orcs being clumsy marksmen rarely hunt bird, thus they use fur and sometimes hair from various animals and creatures as arrow feathers. For protection the archers wear simple and worn-out scavenged armor pieces, as they need the freedom of movement to wield their bows. They carry a dagger and crude short swords to defend themselves at close combat, which none of the archers would like to experience.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.

{Ents_Elephants_autonomy}	Enti
{Ents_Elephants_autonomy_descr}
These shepherds of the forest are the answer to Yavanna's prayers on behalf of the tress of Middle-Earth. Created during Arda's Spring in the First Age the Ents were intended to safe-guard the forests of the world from greedy axes and ensure the survival of Yavanna's fruits. Unfortunately Melkor's and Sauron's wars wrought great destruction upon Middle-Earth's forests and by the time of the Third Age the Ents became isolated and contained to Fangorn Forest. Feeling betrayed and forgotten they care not for the wars and struggles of Middle-Earth's peoples, spending their time tending to the last remnants of the ancient primeval forests. As the conflict between the Free Peoples and Sauron escalates it may soon spill out into Fangorn, the Ents' last refuge, and should that come to pass the forest shepherds' wrath may become known once more. Ents differ greatly in size, appearance and form just like the different species of trees that they guard and which they tend to resemble. The one trait all Ents share is their immense strength which is said to surpass even the mighty trolls who are said to be Morgoth's imitation of Ents. Therefore, when enraged, the apparently docile forest shepherds can turn into frightening opponents able to crush most flesh and blood creatures with a single blow or swipe of their powerful limbs. However their apathy towards anything that doesn't concern their woodland domain may make stirring them into a war-like disposition difficult.\nEnts can only be received if Fangorn is given autonomy.

{Hobbit_Archers_autonomy}	 Hobití lučištníci
{Hobbit_Archers_autonomy_descr}
Hobbits may be small but they have a good eye and a well placed arrow, even from one of their short bows, can prove a painful thorn in an army's side. Their small size serves them well as they can be hard to glimpse amid trees or tall grass which can provide them with first strike advantage. If kept away from the heat of battle these Shire-folk can be a valuable asset on the field. Just remember that hobbits are much better at farming fields than doing battle on them.\nHobbit units can only be received if all settlements of the Shire are owned and are given autonomy.

¬----------------
{Bandobras_Archers_autonomy}	 Brandorádští lučištníci
{Bandobras_Archers_autonomy_descr}
Bandobras Archers receive their name from Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took, one of the tallest hobbits in Shire history who led the Hobbitry-in-Arms in the Battle of Greenfields where he charged the orcish chieftain upon a horse and knocked off his head with a club. These are the gruffest of hobbits and the few among their kind who follow the call of the warrior. It is the hobbits' peace loving nature rather than a lack of physical ability that makes them unsuitable for war but those halflings who are of a sterner disposition can be as dangerous in combat as the "Big Folk". Utilizing their smaller size, good hand-eye coordination and stocky build the Bandobras Archers can slay their opponents from afar using short war-bows or in close quarter with their short swords. Their bravery and versatility makes them a potent force.\nHobbit units can only be received if all settlements of the Shire are owned and are given autonomy.

Hobbitry-in-Arms are Shire's militia force called upon through the Shire-muster in rare times of emergency. As evil awakens in the Misty Mountains and surrounding lands the emergencies are becoming less and less rare and though peace loving by nature hobbits will defend themselves if need be. There are few weapons in the Shire as hobbits have little need of them but there are some and farming tools can be a potent tool of war as well. The life of a warrior is an unappealing prospect to the large majority of Shire-folk but they are a deceptively courageous people and any general commanding them in battle should show respect for the halflings' fighting spirit by not throwing away their lives in impossible situations.\nHobbit units can only be received if all settlements of the Shire are owned and are given autonomy.

{Legolas_Bodyguards_descr}
Trespassing into a wood held by the Silvan Elves is, quite literally, suicide. If within the first moments of your trespassing your body sprouts feather-fletched arrows, then a company of Silvan Archers is likely the culprit. These elven battalions patrol the reaches of the Silvan realm, slaying every manner of evil in their wake, whether it be as minor as a large spider or as deadly as a cave troll. Protected by lightweight leather armor beneath their cloaks while wielding bows and Elven blades, these excellent archers excel at guerilla tactics, using stealth to ambush any enemy that dares enter their sacred homelands. Besides being superb waylayers, Silvan Archers are reliable units, useful for steadily thinning enemy ranks with their deadly volleys of arrows and can become capable melee units if necessary. These Sentinels, due to their ambush abilities and archery skill, compose the backbone of most Silvan armies.

The Hobbitry-in-Arms is the best defense Hobbits can provide, outside of good pipe-weed that is. This militia is equipped with pole-arms and working tools. They might seem small and weak, but you shouldn’t underestimate their archery skills. You should use these Hobbits for laying ambush to the enemy, but you should keep them out of melee. They are slightly better at melee fighting than the Snaga morons from the caves, but they don’t have as high of numbers and they don’t stand a chance against the bigger creatures in Middle-Earth.

It can take on a Corsair ship and hope to win, and if engaged by a Corsair Marauder might even hope for a draw if captained skilfully.

Warfare is no stranger to the folk of Durin, who have often found need for taking up arms in order to protect or further their interests. Warriors such as these, armed with hand axes and equipped with wooden shields, make up the bulk of dwarven armies and are often called to arms, whether to quest for greater riches abroad or to forcibly discourage the greedy advances of those who may lust after the wealth of the Dwarves.

{Dwarven_Halberdmen_Mercs}	Trpasličí halapartníci
{Dwarven_Halberdmen_Mercs_descr}
Against men and elves, Dwarves are particularly disadvantaged by their short stature. To remedy this shortcoming, some dwarven warriors have adopted the halberd, the crude -- though effective -- combination of an axe head and a long pole. In orderly formations, halberds allow dwarves to hold enemies off at range. However, for combat in close quarters, a dwarven halberdier will often switch to a double-bladed axe in order to finish off his enemies.

Although most of the races of Middle-earth favor the use of sword and spear in the conduct of war, no weapon is perhaps as associated with the Dwarves as is the axe. Indeed, axes are as useful to Dwarves as tools in times of peace as they are as weapons in times of war. Furthermore, the natural strength and stocky build of the Dwarves give them a particular affinity for wielding axes. Few there are who can withstand the might of a single dwarf armed to the teeth and wielding a long-hafted axe. Fewer still are there who can endure against an entire company of dwarven axemen.

{Iron_Crossbowmen_Mercs_descr}
Dwarves are no strangers to the bow, though of late those among the folk of Durin with aptitude in archery have increasingly adopted use of an new innovation, the crossbow. Indeed, for the stout dwarven archer a stock-mounted weapon such as the crossbow is far less cumbersome to fire than a more traditional bow. Furthermore, few other than the Dwarves possess the skill in metalwork necessary for the crafting of the intricate trigger mechanisms that give the crossbow its particular utility. Admittedly, a crossbow cannot match a bow in terms of its rate of fire. However, it can impart a projectile with far greater kinetic energy with a more traditional bow. As such, a dwarven crossbow is in many respects similar the one who wields it: slow, though powerful and deadly.

Erebor, the Kingdom under the Mountain, was founded by Thráin I of the folk of Durin after the loss of Khazad-dûm. Under his leadership and that of subsequent kings, the Dwarves of Erebor amassed wealth to rival that of the Dwarven mansions of ages past. With such wealth, however, came unwanted attention, and in time the kingdom was sacked and its treasures lost to Smaug, the last of the fire-drakes. It was not until many years later that Erebor was reclaimed and the Kingdom restored. Having so recently recovered their lost wealth, the Dwarves of Erebor are not likely to give it up lightly, and as such these elite warriors, each bearing a great battle-axe and encased in steel, keep vigilant watch over the Lonely Mountain. Those who covet their treasures know well their fearsome war cry -- Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!\nREQUIRES EREBOR

Heavily armored and equipped with long pikes, these warriors are trained to maintain cohesiveness upon the battlefield so that they can provide a bulwark against even the strongest enemy charge. As a result, companies of Vault Wardens are not particularly flexible, though they are extremely effective in holding key positions in the battle line.

Dale's traditional mastery of the bow is famed throughout Middle-earth. It was inherited from the ancestral culture of the woodmen, as the refugees of Rhovanion were exiled in Greenwood the Great for so many centuries. As the northmen re-emerged and established Dale the bow came with them. In the open landscape that stretches and rolls south from the Iron Hills along the rivers Running and Redwater the bow continued to be relevant to military use. Adapted from Silvan-Elvish influence as a hunting and raiding weapon, the longbow's impressive range allows northmen to defend their homesteads keeping the fast moving easterlings at a distance.

For Dale, the sword could be just as much the symbol of their nation as the bow. These swordsmen are simplistic but rough and ready soldiers who can be raised from the masses and sent out to fight at a moment's notice. Although they have limited skills on the field they are a sturdy and dependable element of the infantry regiments.

Using the cover of missiles they can disrupt enemy formations or screen a potential charge, they are primary infantry who tackle their foes head-on. They can be vulnerable to combined forces such as missile troops and cavalry however and require flanking support.

{Silvan_Sword_Mercs_descr}
Forest Wardens are the unseen part of an elven army. These Silvan Elves have lived in the woods for a long time and have perfected the art of stealth and hiding. Many Orcs have fallen to their blades without even knowing who killed them or seeing no more then a shadow moving through the woods. However, these units aren't equipped to keep up a prolonged fight. If they fail to completely destroy an enemy they must run away and lay another ambush, as surprise is their biggest strength.

It is said that Noldor archers are the Rain of Death that precedes the Whirlwind unleashed by their sword wielding comrades. With keen eyes, ages worth of experience, and arrows capable of piercing dragon scales, Noldorin bowmen can decimate the ranks of their foes before the battle is even properly joined. Despite their supporting role in the army, battlefields are littered with corpses of enemies who foolishly believed that getting into melee range of these warriors would provide them with sufficient advantage. The benefit of Noldorin skill, craftsmanship, and spirit ensures that these archers will not be easily routed even when properly countered.

{Elf_Spear_Mercs_descr}
Taking their lessons from such great battles that changed the face of Arda, such as Dagor Bragollach, Nirnaeth Arnoediad, or the War of the Last Alliance, High Elves know what it means to "hold the line." Despite the Firstborn's decline this proud legacy lives on in the ranks of Elven Spearmen. Elven mail, reinforced by fine leather to cushion the blow, behind a sturdy leaf-shaped shield provides premium protection. On the offensive side, the almost 3 metres long razor sharp spear with a slightly curved blade, suitable for slashing as well as thrusting, warns most enemies to keep their distance or perish. All this coupled with the Elves' determination to stand against the darkness makes the Elven Spear Wall one of, if not the most formidable battle line in all of Middle-earth.

These excellent warriors hail from the timeless woodland kingdom of Lorien where they serve as forest wardens and protectors of Galadriel's domain. Centuries of combat experience inside forested areas makes them superb ambushers and snipers who combine stealth and versatility with deadly results. Their long leather coats provide good protection while allowing for the mobility needed to wield their powerful longbows and two-handed curved blades. Fiercely loyal to their Noldorin, Lady Lorien's finest march out against the elves' foes at Her behest.

Ačkoli jsou vynikající hlavně pro strážní službu a odrážení malých skupin nájezdníků, tak je dobrý velitel může dobře použít i ve vážnějších střetnutích, protože se mohou ukázat jako velmi houževnatí vojáci s jejich pevnými štíty a meči.

Tito pelargirští námořníci jsou obvykle používáni k ochraně Gondorských obchodních cest a obchodních lodí, ale mají také roli městských stráží. Vzhledem k důležitosti Pelargiru bylo město často napadáno a obléháno korzáry, což z pelargirských námořníků udělalo bojem zakalené vojáky.

Although these archers are not as skilled as Elves, nor do they wield the fabled hollow steel bow of the Númenóreans, they should still be a force to reckon with. The strength and stature of these archers means they can shoot a Longbow with ease, even if they’re clad in full plate armour. The armour means they need a longer time to reload their great bows and are slow to move, but they will stand their ground in melee combat. Armed with a sword and trained as Gondorian Infantry, they fear few enemies and are expected to fend off most attacking infantry.

Though the Gondorians of Blackroot Vale are a rustic people far from the more civilized coastlines of Dol Amroth and Pelargir or the high walls of Minas Tirith, they are known across the land as skilled bowmen and are a welcome addition to Gondor's armies. Living so close to the slopes of the White Mountains these archers are used to difficult terrain and due to their life style are quite self-sufficient being able to craft their own arrows and maintain their bows while living off the land and surviving by hunting.

They function as both bodyguards for the Princes and Lords of Dol Amroth, and also as a vital part of Gondor’s mounted forces. They wear the finest armour the smiths in Gondor can manufacture, and even their mounts are heavily armoured.

The axe is an invaluble tool to the Rohirrim in times of peace and a deadly weapon in times of war. The men that wield it are usually not professional soldiers, but that does not mean they should not be feared. The blood of the middle men burns brightly in their veins, and the servants of the Dark Lord would be folly to cross them. They also carry a shield and mail, and their axe gives them a consideable advantage over heavily armed opponents.

Though the axe is a popular weapon for soldiers of Rohan, wielding a sword shows that the wielder is a man of more than average combat skill. These swordsmen hail from the Folds of Rohan, minor noblemen, freemen, and veteran soldiers – they all have superior training to the common soldiers. They are clad in decent armour, all wearing at least ring-mail, their endurance in battle depending on it. At times if the need arises, the Rohirrim fight on foot, and they do it as well as on horseback. These Rohan swordsmen can punish most other infantry.

Rohan Riders are medium armoured companies which form the backbone of Rohan's army. These companies are formed from horsemen who cannot afford expensive heavy armour. Still, their lighter armour protects vital body areas and allows these riders to be fast and agile. Without heavy armour and with unarmoured horses, these units are cheaper to equip and make deadly, mobile cavalry that can strike hard and pull out quick, and then repeat until the enemy has had enough.

Being a nation that that has such a rich history of cavalry it is only natural to have mounted archers. Armed with a good bow and coupled with a swift horse, these horse archers can be a formidable force. These men give Rohan the long range that they desperately need without having to be slowed down by foot archers. Armed with an axe when close quarters ensues, they are capable of self-defense, but it's best to keep these men out of the thick of battle, for they lack a shield and the heavier armour of their more melee-based counterparts.

With the advent of a new war they had been tasked with probing Gondor's defenses and harassing the elves of Mirkwood and Lorien, but now Sauron's conquests have taken them from their usual prowling grounds straight to the walls of Minas Tirith, Caras Galadhon, and beyond. Though their scavenged and improvised weapons and armour together with a lack of tactical sense for open warfare make them unsuited for head on clashes with decently equipped and disciplined troops, inexperienced or overconfident commanders just might find their lines broken and overrun by the raiders' sheer numbers and beastly aggression.

Bows made by the orcs are of sub-standard quality. Often they would break from extended use, or from not receiving proper care and maintenance, as orcs care little for their tools. Arrows on the other hand are more durable and can be reused time and time again. Most often only the shaft or the feathers need replacement. Orcs being clumsy marksmen rarely hunt bird, thus they use fur and sometimes hair from various animals and creatures as arrow feathers. For protection the archers wear simple and worn-out scavenged armor pieces, as they need the freedom of movement to wield their bows. They carry a dagger and crude short swords to defend themselves at close combat, which none of the archers would like to experience.

Although almost none on Middle-Earth could live in these conditions, there are those who made this place their home, and they are the Haradrim. Even though there are not many things to hunt in Harad, for the desert is too hot to cultivate in some areas, there are still many skilled hunters who had to adapt to these conditions to survive, and those adaptations make them skilled and enduring archers. If the need arises, these hunters would protect their homes from any threat with their bows. Even though they are only equipped with a simple bow and a scimitar, the life in the desert has turned them into fearsome warriors, and the general that doesn't consider them a major factor on the battlefield will be taken by surprise.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.

{Southron_Spearmen_Mercs2_descr}
Life in Harad's dry environment is full of hardship. Food and water are not easy to come by and most of the wealth is unevenly distributed by the warrior elite. Thus many men of Harad, especially young ones, flock to the Haradrian army banner eager for glory and plunder. Protected by leather vests with spears and small round shields in their hands, these war bands march in large numbers to engage the bulk of the enemy force and screen their archers from cavalry charges, while the elites take up more favorable tactical positions. Hardened by life under the blistering Southron sun, these men are not afraid to fight but they won't willingly give their lives either unless there is some worthwhile reward to be gained.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.

{Corsairs_Mercs2_descr}
Hailing from the distant southern region of Umbar, these pirates seem to have Gondorian ancestry, but none of the virtues, which unfortunately does not make them any less dangerous. A constant plight on Gondor's shores, these raiders strike quickly and with a savage ferocity driven by greed and the desire to cause endless grief for their Gondorian rivals. Their cutlasses and machetes lend themselves well to the Corsairs' wild and ferocious fighting style, while their increased mobility at the cost of armour allows them to direct their aggression to the right place at the right time. However, that same destructive recklessness and bullheadedness that makes them so effective may also be their undoing should they run head on into professional armoured or mounted troops.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.\nREQUIRES COASTAL REGION

The lands to the southeast of Mirkwood are inhabited by the rements of the Balchoth. These warlike tribes invaded the west only to meet defeat at the hands of the fledging Rohirrim. Pushed back into the foothills along the Sea of Rhun, their lust for battle has not diminished in the years since their invasion and defeat. Called on by Warlords and the Lôke-Khan as mercenaries, their tribesmen are ferocious warriors capable of ambushing an enemy and quickly disappearing into the shadows from whence they came. They carry menacing javelins, crude axes, and hand-scythes. Chiefly used for protecting archers or infantry flanks, they have been used by Warlords as a main battle line where there ferocity in a general melee was on display for all to see.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.

When a Warlord calls upon the clans they are to supply a quota of able bodied men based on past service and their current clan size. Because of their nomadic style and the lands they inhabit, the Easterlings have become excellent archers. When not called upon to form part of the infantry, the clansmen are usually formed into archer groups. Using smaller composite bows, that can also be used from horseback, the clansmen archers possess considerable range and deadly impact. As side arms they carry similar weapons as their infantry counterparts.\n\nThe unit will disband if it has participated in an invasion.
